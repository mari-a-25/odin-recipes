    <p>This apple crisp showcases apples at their best! <br> 
        The combination of warm, tender apples and the crunchy <br> 
        oat topping is one of my favorite desserts. <br>
        Delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. <br> <br>
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Apples:</b> You'll need 10 cups of peeled, cored, and sliced all-purpose apples.</li>

        
Sugars: This apple crisp recipe calls for white sugar in the filling and brown sugar in the topping.
Flour: All-purpose flour thickens the filling and gives the topping some structure.
Cinnamon: A teaspoon of ground cinnamon lends warmth that perfectly complements the apples' flavor.
Oats: Use quick-cooking oats for the topping.
    </ul>
