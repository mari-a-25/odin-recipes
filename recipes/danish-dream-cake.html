    <h1>Danish Dream Cake Recipe</h1>

    <p>This Danish dream cake is a soft vanilla cake with an easy broiled coconut-caramel icing with a slightly crisp texture that contrasts nicely with the tender cake. For some of us, this cake, also called Lazy Daisy Cake or Lazy Day Cake, was the first cake our grandmothers taught us to make. A serrated knife helps to cut through the topping when slicing the cake.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Cake</h3>
     
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li><br>
        <li>3/4 cup whole milk</li><br>
        <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li><br>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li><br>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li><br>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li><br>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li><br>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract</li><br>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li><br>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li><br><br>
    </ul>

    <h3>Topping</h3><br>
    <ul>
        <li> 5 tablespoons unsalted butter</li><br>
        <li>1/4 cup whole milk</li><br>
        <li>1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar</li><br>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li><br>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li><br>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut</li><br>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li><br><br>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch square pan with enough parchment to have overhang on all sides.</li><br>

        <li>For cake, place butter and milk in a microwave-safe bowl. Cook, stirring often, until butter is melted and mixture is hot, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes.</li><br>

        <li>Add eggs, white sugar, salt, and nutmeg to a large bowl, and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until mixture has lightened in color and tripled in volume, 3 to 5 minutes. Add in vanilla extract and almond extract and beat until combined. Add flour and baking powder and mix on low speed until nearly incorporated, but some dry bits of flour still remain. With mixer running on low speed, gradually pour in hot butter-milk mixture and beat until incorporated. Pour batter into the prepared pan.</li><br>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes.</li> <br>

        <li>Meanwhile, for topping, place butter, milk, brown sugar, salt and nutmeg into a high-sided microwave-safe bowl. Cook, stirring after every 1 minute, until sugar is dissolved and mixture is bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the microwave and stir in coconut flakes and vanilla.</li><br>

        <li>Remove cake from the oven and preheat the oven's broiler. Carefully pour topping over the hot cake, and gently spread into an even layer, covering the top of the cake.</li><br>

        <li>Place cake under the broiler; broil until topping is bubbling and slightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove cake from the oven; cool in the pan for about 15 minutes, then use parchment overhang to remove to a wire rack to cool completely.</li><br>
